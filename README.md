## Hi there 👋

I'm Xinqi Lin, a second-year graduate student @[XPixelGroup](https://github.com/XPixelGroup). My main research interests are image restoration and super-resolution.

I'm looking for a 26-fall PhD program 🙏🙏🙏.

## My Projects 🚀
- [DiffBIR](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/DiffBIR) ![Github stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/XPixelGroup/DiffBIR.svg): Image restoration tool based on Stable Diffusion. This is my first work in image restoration. It achieves good results, but it's relatively slow.
- [HYPIR](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/HYPIR) ![Github stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/XPixelGroup/HYPIR.svg): One-step image restoration tool, significantly outperforms DiffBIR while also being tens of times faster. It yielded from a diffusion model, but it's definitely not a diffusion model!
- upscaler.cpp (coming soon): This is a **pure C++** image restoration/super-resolution toolkit, built on [ggml](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml) (you might know [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)?). I prefer C/C++ over Python, and I'm very familiar with image restoration/super-resolution, so I wrote this library.
